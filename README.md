# ðŸ§¬ Phenoage Regression

This project demonstrates a MLOps service for estimating the **biological age** (PhenoAge) based on publicly available health data (NHANES).  
Unlike chronological age, biological age reflects a person's actual physiological condition and risk profile. It is increasingly used in preventive medicine, longevity research, and health technology. This project is done within the course MLOps Zoomcamp to demonstrate all visited MLOps concepts and best-practices.

The goal is to build a lightweight regression model that approximates **PhenoAge** â€” a clinically validated aging biomarker â€” using only **non-invasive, easily measurable features** such as BMI, blood pressure, physical activity, and lifestyle factors.

By replacing complex lab tests with accessible input data, the project shows how machine learning can support **low-threshold, scalable health insights**â€”and serves as a fully reproducible **MLOps case study** with potential applications in digital health tools.
